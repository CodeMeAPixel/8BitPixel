1. Email us at support@bytebrush.dev with a detailed description of the vulnerability
2. Include steps to reproduce the issue
3. If possible, provide information about the scope and impact of the vulnerability
4. Allow us reasonable time to respond and address the vulnerability before any public disclosure

### What we promise

When you report a security vulnerability to us, we commit to:

- Acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible, typically within 48 hours
- Providing regular updates on our progress as we investigate the issue
- Working diligently to validate and fix the vulnerability
- Crediting you (if desired) when we announce the resolution of the issue

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to 8BitPixel Arcade, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Third-party dependencies**: Always verify that third-party libraries and dependencies are from trusted sources and don't introduce security vulnerabilities

2. **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs and never trust client-side data

3. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention**: Always sanitize and validate user-generated content before rendering it

4. **Sensitive data**: Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials, etc.) to the repository

5. **Code reviews**: All code should be reviewed with security considerations in mind

## Security Updates

Security updates will be distributed via:

- GitHub releases and tags
- Announcement in the repository's README or documentation
- Direct notifications to users who have starred or watched the repository

We encourage all users to stay up-to-date with the latest releases to ensure they have all security fixes.

## Security-Related Configuration

The 8BitPixel platform includes several security measures:

1. **Content Security Policy**: The application uses CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

2. **CORS Policies**: Configured to allow only trusted domains

3. **Input Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized and validated

4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular automated checks for vulnerable dependencies
